Need to provide power distribution protection (over-current, over-temp, shorts, etc)

Extremely extended pads on ATMEGA48 for probing and to support ECO's if necessary.

ATMEGA48 center heat-sink pad is left floating (on smask)

Emergency Motor Stop and Power Savings are implemented on the ATMEGA48 motor controller and IRMAN. Code must be VERY sure to kill the PWM outputs on startup init routine.

Note: Resetting the motor controller MCU causes all-stop condition.

Motor control protocol:
1-byte commands in this format: (MSb) +xxx+yyy (LSb)

+xxx = signed-magnitude value representing 2^3-1 speeds forward, 2^3-1 speeds in reverse and stop (2 codes 1000,0000). Controls LEFT motor.

+yyy = same as +xxx, but for opposite motor. Controls RIGHT motor.

The 2 stop codes are actually slightly different:
1000 = brake to a stop (more electrical noise, power consumption, but faster)
0000 = coast to a stop

Examples:
(msb) 01111111 -- sping clockwise at maximum speed (left motor forward speed 7, right motor reverse at speed 7)

(msb) 10001000 -- brake both motors

(msb) 00110101 -- slight right turn (left motor forward at speed 3, right motor forward at speed 5)

----------------------------------

Max V,wall_input is 15? (Diode is 20V,max)
No protection against AC inputs is provided

Motor Amp is not current-limited. Be careful! (not exactly true, we now have current monitoring, but no automatic reaction circuitry).
Motor Amp idle current is too high, so the enable lines are not used. Instead an external power gate is provided. 
Make sure to stop motor before putting amp to sleep.

Motor control is implemented with PWM Enable-chopping. This is done because:
1. More efficient mechanically for forward drive (no braking in off-times)
2. Simpler for the paricular hardware to control
But...
1. More noise (back-EMF)
2. More ripple (chopping-noise)
3. Slightly higher current consumption since recirculation effect is reduced.
Ragobot will not actually have an electrical brake because its mechanical resistance is high enough to cause it to stop virtually immediately

IRMAN can not reset the BRAIN MCU

Motor controller creates dominant noise spike at its PWM frequency (600Hz for Polulu) (harmonics, do not appear significant)
Mote supply shows dominant noise frequency at 100kHz (with HF harmonics)

Cliff detector IR is 1.42V (5mA)

IR software might do best of 4 averaging
Offers BRAIN a command called "flatten", which resets the IR threshold based on the BRAIN's knowledge that the Ragobot is on flat ground and "safe"

Surface reflectivities *severly* impact IR obstacle avoidance

WM1752-ND Connector (Header)
WM1730-ND Housing
WM1142CT-ND Pins

Rover Connector Assembly Instructions
1. Use solder/heatshrink to add 26 gauge extensions to the 24gauge motor lines
2. Crimp on 26gauge Molex pins
3. Insert into WM1730-ND housing

The addition of an EXPANSION module may decrease IR obstacle detection performance. Application designers should take note.


Section on SOS

IRMAN Debug_Wire (internal Ragobot is compliant with loading spec for Debug_Wire) & MOTE JTAG are available for implementation on the EXPANSION header

40KHZ ENCODER SIGNAL PULLS TO EXPANSION HEADER TO FACILITATE EXPANSION OF THE IR ARRAY IF NECESSARY

added x_HIPRI signal at EXPANSION interface so that EXPANSION device can signal hi-priority interrupt to BRAIN

VBatt is available from the Battery Monitor and is not provided to the Sensor ADC as originally envisioned.

RESERVED pins should be left floating (high-Z) by user expansion hardware

It may be possible for the user to create power-leaking configurations, for example installing four servos with a BRAIN like XYZ that can only control 2.

BRAIN reset does not offer any pull-up on the BODY... this is the responsibility of the BRAIN module itself or its adapter.

PFET on 5V Supply is 20nC (extremely low, 1/5th of typical) and 20m-Ohm (on the order of an n-FET).

RFID reader can be used on I2C or SERIAL by making the BRAIN adapter board wire the 2 SERIAL pins into the I2C bus, but just remember that this converts the these pins on the EXPANSION header as well!
