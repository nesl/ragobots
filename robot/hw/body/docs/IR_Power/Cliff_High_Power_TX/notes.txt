Cliff Detector, IR Lamp
at 1.434V and 5mA supply
driven through nFET amp from MCU
Signal is modulated
40% modulation envelope duty cycle
This plot is an analysis WITHIN that 40% window (i.e. where fully active)

570uS active
Average current during active period is (335.5mV)
335mV = 15mA in our setup
