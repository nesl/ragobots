Ragobot Rev.C Assembly Notes:
RBTBDYC
==============================
GERBER
------
Filenames are "RAGOBOT" with the following extensions:

.OTL	BOARD OUTLINE
.TOP	TOP METAL
.BOT	BOTTOM METAL
.DRI	NC DRILL

.SMB	SOLDER MASK BOTTOM
.SMT	SOLDER MASK TOP
.SPB	SOLDER PASTE BOTTOM
.SPT	SOLDER PASTE TOP
.SST	SILK SCREEN TOP
.SSB	SILK SCREEN BOTTOM

LEDS
----
D7, D8, D9, D10 (Thruhole tri-color LEDs are on the TOP side of the board, with the diffuser overhanging the edge of the board -- i.e., LED's face out from PCB)

D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, DDSCL, D_BCU, D_IRISL, D_IRISU (SMT LED's)  The tick mark (looks like -> " ^ ") on the end of the silk-screen place-outline for these parts indicates the Cathode, which is indicated on the actual part by a line.

The IR LED's (D12-D17) should be soldered in from the bottom *PRIOR* to installing the IR Receivers (IR1-IR6).

The IR LED's (D12-D17) should be oriented as indicated on the bottom silk-screen with their diffusers pointed away from the center of the board.

RN1 should be placed before the LED BAR GRAPH. The LED BAR GRAPH goes on top of the RN1. 

SENSORS
-------
ACCEL1 (Accelerometer) Pin 1 is marked by a 1 on the silkscreen and a dot on the IC.

MAG1 (Magnetometer) Pin 1 is marked by a 1 on the silkscreen and a dot on the IC.

IR Receivers (IR1-IR6) should be installed *AFTER* the IR LED's (D12-D17) are soldered in from the bottom.


CONNECTORS
----------
"BRAIN" (also labeled "BRAIN1") -- Polarity is guided by boss holes and trapezoidal land pattern.

"HEAD" (also labeled "J16") -- Polarity is guided by trapezoidal land pattern.

IC's
----
DBNCE1 -- Pin 1 has a wider land pattern than the other three. The corner of the place outline, by Pin 1, on the top silkscreen is indented, but this is difficult to see on the actual PCB (check the Gerber: RAGOBOT.SST if necessary)
